Algorithm (plr.em_algorithm)
Require: r (scRNAseq data) and h (ISH data)
Output: the optimized parameters (gamma, pi, A, b, and sigma)

initialize pi to 1/K (K: Number of cells containing in ISH data)
initialize A and b as r and Ah +b has the same mean and variance for each element
initialize sigma to the variance of each element of r
initialize likelihood = -infinity
Repeat
    update gamma by eq. (11)
    update pi by eq. (12)   #this step would be skipped if optimize_pi = False
    update A and b by eq. (13 and 14)
    update sigma by eq. (15)
    set old_likelihood = likelihood
    update likelihood by eq. (10)
Until old_likelihood - likelihood > 0
Return gamma, pi, A, b, and sigma
